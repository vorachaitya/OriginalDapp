Creating a decentralized application and deploying it on Metamask using Goerli Test Network.

I have also created a basic frontend using HTML and connected the smart contract with frontend.

We can set our current mood by clicking **_set_mood_** button which will perform transaction on Metamask and then view it using **_get_mood_** button.

We have to pay price in the form of ethers while perfomring tranctions,i.e, setting the mood because it will paid as a fee to miner for mining our blocks.However,we won't be charged any ether while viewing the mood,i.e,get_mood because here no work is done by miners,so no fees needs to be paid to them.
